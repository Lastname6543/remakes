# remakes

Hello! This repository contains the project files for my electronic music remakes that I am happy to share with everyone. For those who are unfamiliar with GitHub, there is an option to download the files as a ZIP file by clicking the "Code" button near the top right of the main dashboard.

Some instruments are from Ableton Live libraries or packs so I'm not sure if they will be able to be imported correctly. Most of the other instruments are VST plugins so you need them if not they also won't work.

Do consider subscribing to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/QuarkZero/) too. Thanks!
